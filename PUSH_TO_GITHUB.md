## 🔧 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `UrbanFlowAI-Vision-Engine` (or your choice)
3. Description: "AI-powered vision system for urban traffic and parking management"
4. **Visibility:** 
   - ✅ **Public** (recommended for portfolio/showcase)
   - OR Private (if confidential)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create UrbanFlowAI-Vision-Engine --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Push to GitHub

### After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/teodor/UrbanFlow

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/UrbanFlowAI-Vision-Engine.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Example (replace with your actual username):

```bash
# If your GitHub username is "johndoe"
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/UrbanFlowAI-Vision-Engine.git
git push -u origin main
```
